#+TITLE: ransomts emacs customization

Here's my shot at making a portable, modular, and org-anized configuration. I use this configuration on several machines with and without Xorg or consistant package updates. 

Just about every src block in [[file:lisp/config.org][lisp/config.org]] can be taken as a unit block to use in other configs.

Features:
 - Org mode src blocks group relevant packages
 - use-package
   - migrated customize.el settings into package specific configs
   - proper load ordering and conditional ordering
 - exwm configuration
   - several multi-monitor machines
   - many simulation keys
   - several xf86 multimedia keys supported
 - configuration for several large emacs packages
   - org
   - erc
   - eshell
   - dired
   - helm
   - magit
   - slime
   - theme (with change on sunrise/sunset)
