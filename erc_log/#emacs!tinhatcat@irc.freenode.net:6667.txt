*** #emacs was created on 2006-11-26 01:42:33
<parsnip> hmm, i cleared some cache, i think the \\ may have fixed it
*** #emacs URL: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsChannel
<parsnip> ah, the lowercase c:/ may not have even been an issue, just the
	  slashes  [17:46]
<tinhatcat> Hi, I'm looking for a way to collapse rows in an org mode table
	    based on the elements in a column. For example take the average of
	    a column with rows that match on a different column, I've written
	    an example in https://codeshare.io/collapse  [17:47]
<parsnip> oh mi god, so they pointlessly had dart-formatter-command looking
	  for dartfmt.exe, which is now called dartfmt.bat. but you can simply
	  use "dart", it will still find dart.bat  [17:50]
<parsnip> but if i fix that, it's now looking for `diff`  [17:51]
<parsnip> but this came from go-mode.el, so does this mean their formatter
	  doesn't work in Windows also?  [17:55]
<parsnip> yep, https://github.com/dominikh/go-mode.el/issues/105  [17:56]
<userr> Whats the best way to start execution of a python script at the end of
	my .emacs?  [18:05]
<dale> Oof, TIL let-alist.  (let-alist '((foo . bar)) (message "this works:
       %S" .foo))  [18:06]
<offby1> userr: dunno; ,,call-process might do it  [18:15]
<fsbot> I want to TAKE IT HOME and DRESS IT UP in HOT PANTS!!
<offby1> ,df call-process
<fsbot> call-process is a built-in function in `C source code'.
<fsbot> (call-process PROGRAM &optional INFILE DESTINATION DISPLAY &rest ARGS)
<fsbot> Call PROGRAM synchronously in separate process.
<fsbot> The remaining arguments are optional. ;;[ ,more/ ,dump]
<parsnip> call-parsnip? who shall i execute?  [18:17]
<notzmv> ,who
<fsbot> BEEEP: Wrong number of arguments: (lambda (fs-verb &rest fs-whatever)
	(erblisp-check-args-nascent) (sit-for 0) (fs-format "I %s!" (fs-or
	(fs-cdr (fs-assoc fs-verb (quote ((is . "am") (does . "do") (did .
	"did") (has . "have") (was . "was") (will . "will"))))) "do"))), 0
<notzmv> weow  [18:18]
<aidalgol> Does Emacs have any decent wrapper for git blame?  [18:37]
<dale> aidalgol: Since you're asking I'm guessing vc-annotate is not what you
       want?  [18:38]
<aidalgol> dale: No, it kinda sucks.
<dale> aidalgol: I *think* Magit probably has something, and there's also
       git-timemachine.
<aidalgol> You mean the Atom extension?  [18:39]
<dale> aidalgol: https://gitlab.com/pidu/git-timemachine  [18:40]
<dale> aidalgol: (I thought you were joking until I googled it and saw the
       Atom extension of (almost) the same name was at least the first two
       hits.)
<aidalgol> Turns out magit-blame is what I wanted.  [18:48]
<aidalgol> Right... magit does not seem to like DOS line endings.
<notzmv> does anyone?  [18:49]
<cjbayliss> ??  [18:50]
<fsbot> I'm telling you, you don't want to know!
<notzmv> uh oh
<aidalgol> As much as I like to say "fuck Windows", I have to work with
	   Windows shit.  [18:52]
<twb> And you can't use GNU/ntoskrnl for most of it?  [18:53]
<aidalgol> twb: Corporate finally set me up with a sanctioned Ubuntu box.
<bremner> don't violate those sanctions  [18:54]
<aidalgol> The problem comes from our git repo having line-ending conversion
	   turned off, because SOMEONE here thinks that is BAAAD.
<bremner> I agree
<aidalgol> that a VCS has NO BUSINESS normalising line-endings.  [18:55]
<bremner> just adjust your f'ing editors
<twb> hahahaha
<twb> kali (i.e. backtrack) is in the windows store
<twb> and the day that happened, kali's support forums exploded with noobs
      asking why they can't do <some action that isn't purely userland>
<aidalgol> bremner: Fine.  Just tell me how to make Magit stop shitting "^M"
	   all over my buffers.
<bremner> yeah, sorry, I can't help there. But it does seem like a bug in
	  magit.  [18:56]
<bremner> the rest of emacs can cope with windows line endings, right?
<twb> aidalgol: that sounds like something that should be fixable with a git
      config
<twb> aidalgol: git config core.eol
<bremner> didn't we just discuss why that wasn't happening?
<aidalgol> YES
<bremner> ok, so it's not just me  [18:57]
<twb> Are you saying the ^Ms are from git's own messages, or from git showing
      the contents of CRLF files?
<bremner> twb: so have you got all the newly required backdoors installed in
	  your software?
<aidalgol> It's not happening, because we have a) mixed line-endings, b) a mix
	   of dos and unix line-endings, and c) THAT DOESN'T EVEN WORK
	   PROPERLY
<twb> bremner: nope  [18:58]
<twb> bremner: nobody has asked us yet
<bremner> you'd have to say that, wouldn't you?
<twb> I dunno
<bremner> or maybe "no comment"
<aidalgol> Oh, and guess what?  core.eol is ALREADY SET TO "NATIVE".
<twb> Most of our userbase is detainees, though, so they're already spied on
<twb> aidalgol: shouldn't it be set to LF?
<twb> aidalgol: so that git doesn't emit CRs  [18:59]
<aidalgol> twb: If I'm reading this correctly, that is the same as native on
	   linux.
<twb> aidalgol: OK I'm confused
<twb> aidalgol: I thought you were using emacs and git *on windows*
<aidalgol> No, I'm on Ubuntu now.  [19:00]
<twb> Ah, and it's the files themselves that contain CRLFs
<twb> From my reading, core.autocrlf will work --- but only if you make *all
      your coworkers* turn it on
<aidalgol> Yeah, which isn't going to happen.
<twb> So in case it's not obvious, the fundamental issue here is that Emacs
      can auto-detect CRLF vs LF, but only per-file, not per-line.  git's own
      output has LFs, but repo contents is CRLF, so a single buffer (git's
      output) has both EOLs.  [19:02]
<twb> git has magic to cope with this, but it assumes LF is the Right Thing in
      the repo, and requires Windows people to fix their gits, and can't work
      in the other direction
<Misha_B> is there a libre alternative to youtube?  [19:04]
<technomancy> Misha_B: peertube is one  [19:06]
* offby1 waves  [19:07]
<twb> SIGH.  MacOS has Python2 not Python3  [19:08]
<offby1> heh
<twb> STILL
<Misha_B> >mac
<dale> Hey, at least it's 2.7!
<Misha_B> yikes
<twb> And very very likely this is because all the Apple python code is still
      not ported to python3, e.g.  calendarserver
<offby1>  /usr/bin/emacs --version GNU Emacs 22.1.1
<twb> offby1: when is that explicitly EOL'd?  [19:09]
<offby1> be nice if they shipped python3 and just called it /usr/bin/python3
<offby1> twb: beats me
<dale> bash 3.2.57!
<twb> $coworker is writing something in *BASH 3* because the target is macos,
      and I'm like... python3.  But that's not installed.
<dale> twb: TIL Apple ships Python code beyond stuff like the ObjC bridge.
<Misha_B> but half the fun is guessing which python is `python`!
<dale> Hm, /usr/bin/perl is somewhat older than I would have expected, too.
